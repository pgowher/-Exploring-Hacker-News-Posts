    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator. On this site,user-submitted stories also known as \"posts\",  receive votes and comments, just like `reddit`. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles. The user posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either `Ask HN` (i.e. user-submitted posts that ask the Hacker News community a specific question) or `Show HN` (i.e. user-submitted posts that introduce the Hacker News community to a project, product or just something interesting).\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the posed questions, we will compare these two types of posts to determine which ones receive more comments and whether posts get more comments at a certain time.\n",
